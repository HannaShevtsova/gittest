He said "Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say if I said that you could?
"Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid"
I said "That sounds pretty good"

Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair but it looked alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A Hero of War, and that's what they'll see
just medals and scars
so damn proud of me
and I brought home that flag
now it gathers dust
but its the flag that I love
and the only flag I'd trust
